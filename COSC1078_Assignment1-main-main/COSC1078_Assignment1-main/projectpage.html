    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The project idea that I have come up with is a video game designed to teach and test users different levels of Australian Sign Language, or Auslan. This can be done through a stage-based game, with different levels of difficulty as the user progresses through the game. Using a camera to motion track the users' movements, the game can use a grading system for the accuracy of the users' sign language skills. Not solely focused on learning sign language, users can customise their character, and earn rewards as they progress.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Australian Sign Language, or Auslan, was recognised as an official language in 1987 (REFERENCE). As of 2016, there were 10,000 native Auslan speakers. As someone who has family members who use Auslan in their day-to-day life, the idea of being able to learn sign language in an interactive way seems appealing.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>500 WORDS OF DESCRIPTION IN DETAIL TO BE DONE!</p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>There are a few tools and technologies required to create such a game. To start, a camera would be necessary to play this kind of game. Without the use of a camera, this game would be unplayable. </p>

    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>There are many different skills required to complete this project. One of them would be knowing how to create and effectively use motion tracking software if there are no open-source models available. Another skill would be the capability to understand Auslan, as this is what the project idea is based on. Game development skills are also required, with an in-depth understanding of how to create a learning-based video game. <br><br>
    It is very feasible to find people that can create a learning-based video game. With someone who understands and uses Auslan, such as an instructor, a specialist in motion tracking would be able to identify the motions of each signed word.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>The outcome of this project idea is a finished, interactive video game in which users learn sign language. Throughout the course of the game, players will have character customisation, and gain rewards for progressing their knowledge. While the project is starting out in Auslan, a future possibility would be to include different recognised sign languages from around the world, increasing accessibility to those who require sign language in their day-to-day lives.</p>
