    <h1>COSC1078 Assignment 1: My Profile</h1>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Name: Cameron Mitchell <br>
    Student Number: s3971747 <br>

    Information: Born and raised in Australia, I have completed Year 12 and previously studied Engineering and Computer Science and Monash (4 years). I only know how to speak English.<br>
    Fun fact: I have won a football grand final in 2013, in which my dad was the coach.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My IT interest started when I was in primary school, when I was about 9 to 10 years old, where I became the M.I.C.E (Mentor in Computer Education) for my class. My role was to look after the school computers, while doing extra learning about computer systems. After this, I started to play video games, and really enjoyed the idea of working with computers in the future.<br><br>
    I chose to come to RMIT because I felt like I needed to switch up my approach to studying. Previously studying at Monash during the pandemic, I felt like I was in a slump and needed to find a way out. After thinking about what I wanted to do, I decided that RMIT was the best place to study IT. I have a few friends who studied at RMIT, and they enjoyed their time here, so I thought I should study here too.<br><br>
    I expect to learn many things while studying IT, both in the IT field and general career skills. Some IT skills I would like to learn are how to code and create a video game, as well as being able to understand a lot about IT networks and information management. Some career skills to learn would be how to effectively communicate my thoughts, work as a team more efficiently, and understand what my colleagues require of me.
    </p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>My ideal job would involve something to do with video games, either playing, creating or testing them. After doing some research about what I would like to do as my future job, I have found a job description that sounds appealing to me. The job is a 'Quality Assurance Tester'.
