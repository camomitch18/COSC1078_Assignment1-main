    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My IT interest started when I was in primary school, when I was about 9 to 10 years old, where I became the M.I.C.E (Mentor in Computer Education) for my class. My role was to look after the school computers, while doing extra learning about computer systems. After this, I started to play video games, and really enjoyed the idea of working with computers in the future.<br><br>
    I chose to come to RMIT because I felt like I needed to switch up my approach to studying. Previously studying at Monash during the pandemic, I felt like I was in a slump and needed to find a way out. After thinking about what I wanted to do, I decided that RMIT was the best place to study IT. I have a few friends who studied at RMIT, and they enjoyed their time here. <br><br>
    I expect to learn many things while studying IT, both in the IT field and general career skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>My ideal job would involve something to do with video games, either playing, creating or testing them. After doing some research about what I would like to do as my future job, I have found a job description that sounds appealing to me. The job is a 'Quality Assurance Tester'.
